To tackle this problem,I implemented features and models like Piepline , StandardScaler , RandomForestClassifier in my solution.I also merged two of the csv files for a better interpretation of the data. I used numpy and the pandas library of python to come up with my solution as mean ROC AUC value as 0.84 (rounded to 2 decimal places).
